                ############################### Steps for Running the Python Flask Server with Model Implementation ###################

AIM: This project implements a leaf disease classification system using machine learning in Python. The classification model is exposed through a Flask server, allowing users to make predictions through a web interface.

-run the 1 st code cell in given Leaf_Disease_Classification_Flask_Server_Side_Code.ipynb file
-run the 2nd code cell-->this runs the flask server.
-open app.html file and upload a image of a leaf to make prediction
